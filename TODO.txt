/* DETAILLED TODO */

Huffman compressed file struct :
INT32 : Nb char
Huffman tree INT 32: Nb symbols
Huffman tree : symbol / code_length / code 
Data 

/* TODO */
- 	Clean up list and binary tree, with separate structures.
-	Create BitStream type ( Should be able to output to memory, as well as to files */
-	Provides following huffman fonction
	DBinaryTree*	Huffman_Build_Tree(char* str,size_t* len);
	int	Huffman_Encode(BitStream* stream,char* str,size_t len);
-	Test compression, Test Decompression ( MD5sum ?)
-	Test compression at different "block fixed size"
-	Idea : Adaptative compression -> Guess best size for each block from build tree infp.
