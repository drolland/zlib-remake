/* TODO */

  * Implement distance,length compression
  * Change relevant function from char* to unsigned short int* ( Alphabet of more thant 256 symbols )
  * Brute force test ratio the whole compression
  * Header should be defined this way
    One Byte : Number of symbols
    Then for each symbol  
    Symbol value : 8 bit
    Code length size special bit: 1 bit 
    Code length : 4 bit if previous is zero, 8 bit if previous is 1	
    Actual code : 1 bit for each bit of the code
  Compressing Huffman Tree Header ? GET INFO !!
-   Test Decompression ( MD5 SUM )

FUTURE :

    * Fixed size compression block size or symbol count seems a no go.  
    
    * Compression Max Performance : what can be achieved by Brute Force ( Trying every symbol count for each block ) ?. Conclude. Is it time to implement the second part of compression ?
   
    * Adptative compression. INFO in FIREFOX BOOKMARK. REREAD DEFLATE.
